# Key-Value in memory database

This project is a experimental key-value in memory database, written in C.
It's far from being a production ready database, but it's a good way to learn.
There is some features that I want to implement in the future, like:

- Configurable parameters like port, max connections, etc.
- Better error handling
- Better logging
- Stats
- Rewrite some parts to better legibility
